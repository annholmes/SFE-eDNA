# SFE-eDNA

This project is summarized here:
https://gvl.ucdavis.edu/news/environmental-dna-metabarcoding-san-francisco-estuary

Data consists of eDNA sample data, collection site data, and barcode sequencing data.

Samples:

  Most eDNA samples are paired with three surveys in the San Francisco Estuary:
  Suisun Marsh Fish Survey 
  Enhanced Delta Smelt Survey 
  Yolo Bypass Rotary Screw Trap

  eDNA was sampled without paired trawl/trap samples to understand small scale differences in species detection in Suisun Marsh

Collection sites:

  Paired samples in the Suisun Marsh Fish Survey were collected at stations:
    SU1 (Suisun Slough)
    PT1 (Petonia Slough)
    DV2 (Denverton Slough)
    NS2 (Nurse Slough)
  The same sites were visited monthly for 6 months, Sept 2019-Feb 2020)
  SMFS is otter trawl

  Paired samples with the Enhanced Delta Smelt Survey: 
    Each site is unique based on the EDSM protocol (37 sites as of 3/12/22)
  EDSM is kodiak trawl and 20mm tow-net 
  
  Yolo Bypass Rotary Screw Trap is a fixed trap sampled multiple times
  
  Unpaired Suisun Marsh samples were collected in:
    Suisun Slough
    Spring Branch
    Denverton Slough
    Nurse Slough
    
Samples will be sequenced using the metabarcoding primers:
  12S rRNA gene barcode (MiFish)
  COI gene barcode (LeRay primers)
  18s rRNA gene barcode (V9 region)
  16S rRNA gene barcode
